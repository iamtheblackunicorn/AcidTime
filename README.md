# ACID TIME :rainbow: :pill:

*Get the current time when on acid.* :rainbow: :pill:

## About :books:

Since I have been researching the *Art Nouveau* movement of late and a lot of acid rock art in the 60s was based on this movement, I decided to write a clock that mimicks that art style.

## Building for Android :hammer:

Make sure that you have the following programs installed:

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio
- Android SDK
- Java JDK

After you have installed these, run this command to generate a keystore for the app.

```bash
$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias key
```

After having done that, move the Java keystore to `android/app` and fill in the fields for the keystore password in the file `android/app/key.properties`.

Finally, run these commands:

You have now generated a release build of *Acid Time*.
